# Mars robot simulation test

This test project contains only one module : the `robot-control-frontend` is a standalone Angular application that will display a robot control interface.   

The control interface allows you to control a simulated robot navigating on a simulated Mars planet that is a flat 5x5 grid.

## How to run 

* You will need to have nodejs and npm installed to run from the sources: 
    1. Compile and run a server :
        ```
        cd robot-control-frontend && ng serve 
        ``` 
    2. Open `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser
